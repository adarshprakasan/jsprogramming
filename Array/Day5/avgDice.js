//? You have observation of n+m 6 sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1-6. n of the observations are went missing and you only have the
//? observation of m rolls. Fortunately you have also calculated the average value of n+m rolls. You are given an integer array rolls of length m where
//? rolls[i] is the value of the ith observation. You are also given two integers mean and n.
